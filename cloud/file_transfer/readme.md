To transfer a file from one virtual machine to another using the scp command, you can follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.

Use the scp command in the following format to copy the file from the source VM to the destination VM:

css
Copy code
*********
scp [options] [source_file] [user@destination_host:destination_path]
**************
Replace the following placeholders in the command:

[options]: You can specify additional options such as -r for recursive copying if you want to copy directories.
[source_file]: The file you want to transfer from the source VM.
[user@destination_host:destination_path]: The destination VM's username, IP address or hostname, and the path where you want to copy the file.
Example:

ruby
Copy code

********************************
scp file.txt user@destination_vm:/path/to/destination/
**********************************
Replace file.txt with the actual file you want to transfer, user with the destination VM's username, destination_vm with the IP address or hostname of the destination VM, and /path/to/destination/ with the desired destination path on the destination VM.

Enter the password for the destination VM's user when prompted.

Wait for the file transfer to complete. Once finished, the file will be available in the specified destination path on the destination VM.

Make sure that the necessary network connectivity and firewall rules are configured to allow the transfer between the two VMs
